# Web-scrapes

The script leverages the lxml and html.parser libraries for HTML parsing and the requests library for web page fetching. Extracted data is cleaned, transformed, and exported to both CSV and Excel formats using the pandas library.

The script is designed to be executed from the command line. It requires Python 3.8 and the installation of the lxml, requests, and pandas libraries using pip.   
While the script aims for robust data extraction, it's important to acknowledge potential limitations such as website changes and data accuracy issues.   
The documentation includes recommendations for future enhancements, such as implementing more robust error handling, integrating with a database, and scheduling automated runs.
